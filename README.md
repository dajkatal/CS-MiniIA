# Computer Science HL MiniIA
This MiniIA takes a set of students as input and outputs the optimal distribution of these students into 10 classes.

## Installation

Requires [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) to work.

```sh
$ pip install numpy
$ cd CS-MiniIA
$ python manage.py runserver
```

## Database

This app uses MySQL to store the data. For the application to work, the credentials of your own MySQL database need to be put in the [settings.py](https://github.com/dajkatal/CS-MiniIA/blob/master/MiniIA/settings.py#L79) folder.
